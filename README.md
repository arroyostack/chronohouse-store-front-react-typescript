# **Frontend Store App 🛍️**

Welcome to my Frontend Store App project! This simple solo project was an exciting endeavor where I put my recently acquired front-end skills into practice. The app is  online store, allowing users to add products to their basket and proceed with a seamless checkout process.

## **🚀 Technologies Utilized**

- **React.js**: This project is crafted using React, the JavaScript library of choice for creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript brings a breath of fresh air into the codebase, providing strong typing and enhanced code quality, which translates into fewer bugs and more maintainable code.
- **Redux**: For effective state management, I harnessed the power of Redux. It offers a centralized store for maintaining the application's state, ensuring a smooth data flow between different components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling the app was made simple thanks to Tailwind CSS. This utility-first CSS framework allowed me to swiftly create a visually appealing and responsive user interface.

## **🧩 Advanced React Patterns**

To ensure the project's maintainability and reusability, I employed advanced React patterns, including:

- **Compound Components**: I leveraged compound components to bundle related UI components together and manage their interaction efficiently.
- **Extended Styles Pattern**: By adopting this pattern, I made it easy to extend and customize styles while keeping the codebase organized and maintainable.

## **💡 Clean Code and SOLID Principles**

Clean code is at the heart of this project. I followed the SOLID principles and adhered and best practices for writing maintainable, scalable, and robust code.
